Homepage for homebrew [click here](http://brew.sh/), run the following command in the command line app.

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Below is a screenshot of what happens when I run this command.

To check if its installed run

    brew -v

This will check the version that is installed, and doubles as a quick check that we can access the "brew" command in the command line.

Congrats! we now have Homebrew installed, which means we can go on too install apps that maybe are not found on OSX or better replacements.
